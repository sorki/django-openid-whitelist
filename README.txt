- OpenID whitelist - 

Easy way to keep your projects private. 

After installation add your OpenID to the whitelist. With this
OpenID it is possible to add another OpenID. If not disabled,
each whitelisted OpenID can be used to whitelist more IDs.


To verify OpenID use `whitelist-check` and `whitelist-check-json` views.

Check view documentation in django admin.



Compatible with:
